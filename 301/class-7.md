## [How I explained REST to my brother]()
1. Who is Roy Fielding?
- He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet…  
- he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to 
talk to all of the machines in the world?
When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
- tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.
- capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

4. What does a GET do?
pick them up
image, text, video, an mp3, a slideshow, whatever. I can GET all of those things the same way given a URL.

5. What does a POST do?
If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.

6. What does PUT do?
 If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT,

7. What does PATCH do?
to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH
