What is functional programming?

Functional Programming is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

Pure functions is the first term to learn when trying to understand functional programming. Pure function, are functions that return the same result if given the same arguments (they are also referred as deterministic), and they do not cause any observable side effects.

What are the benefits of a pure function?

The code is easier to test.
We donâ€™t need to mock anything
The code is consistent

What is immutability?

To say a code is immutable, to mean that it is unchanged or unable to change.

What is Referential transparency?

A function that consistently yields the same result for the same input, is referentially transparent.
