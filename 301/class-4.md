# Readings: React and Forms

## [React Docs - Forms]()
1. What is a ‚ÄòControlled Component‚Äô?üßê
An input form element whose value is controlled by React


2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
With a controlled component, the input‚Äôs value is always driven by the React state. While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
event.target.name.
