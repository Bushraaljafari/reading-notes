### Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
|**SQl**|**NoSQL**|
|---|-----|
| SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)|NoSQl database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database |
|SQL databases have predefined schema	|NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data
|SQL databases are vertically scalable	|NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable
|SQL databases are table based databases	|NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores



1. **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

if the data is highly structured and clearly defined , conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.


2. **Give a real world example.**

 MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL

 3. **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

 NoSQL database good fit at the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.

 4. **Give a real world example.**

 MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.

 5. **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

 NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage.


 6. **Which type of database is best for scalability?**

 SQL databases are vertically scalable, But NoSQL are horizontally scalable.
