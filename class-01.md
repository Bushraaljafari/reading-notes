# Read: 01 - Introductory HTML and JavaScript 

## From the Duckett HTML book:

### HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” (pp.12-39)
- **Is it hard to Learn?**

 it's not that hard to learn how
to write web pages and read
the code used to create them;
you certainly don't have to be a
"programmer."

- [X] How the Web Works

When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

#### HTML code

<html>
<body>

 <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>

 <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
 the page. And if the page is a long one it might
 be split up into several sub-headings.<p>

 <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>

 <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
 you follow the structure of what is being written.
 There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
 headings).</p>

 <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>

 <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>

  </body>
 </html>

  |Grouping Text &Elements In a Block|<div>|
  |Grouping Text &Elements Inline|<span>|
  |Information About Your Pages|<meta>|

  ### HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout” (pp.428-451)

  [link](2.png)

  1. *The <header> and <footer>
elements can be used for:*
- [x] The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
- [x] A header or footer for an
individual <article> or
<section> within the page

2. *The <nav> element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.*

3. The <article> element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.

4. The <aside> element has two
purposes, depending on whether
it is inside an <article>
element or not.

** Summary
HTML5 LAYOUT**

- [x]  The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
- [X] The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
- [x]  Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
- [x]  To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.


### HTML Chapter 18: “Process & Design” (pp.452-475)
 ####  These questions are important to help you design 
- Who is the Site For?
It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.

- Why People Visit YOUR Website
- What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve
- What Your Visitors are
Trying to Achieve
- What Information
Your Visitors Need
- How Often People Will
Visit Your Site

*WireFrames*

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require

## From the Duckett JS book:
### JS Chapter 1: “The ABC of Programming” (pp.11-52)

- **A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal. **
- Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions. 
- Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task programmatically. 
- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help)
-  JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 
- The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
