### Loops and iteration
**The goal of using**
- Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly
- a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another.

#### The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:
- [x] for statement
- [x] do...while statement
- [x] while statement
- [x] labeled statement
- [x] break statement
- [x] continue statement
- [x] for...in statement
- [x] for...of statement


**for statement**


- [x] repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false

*A for statement looks as follows:*
for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
 {statement} 

**while statement**
- [x] A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true


* A while statement looks as follows:

while (condition)
 {statement} 

- ** Example**

- The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than 3:

let n = 0;
let x = 0;
while (n < 3) {
  n++;
  x += n;
