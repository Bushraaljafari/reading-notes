**Images**

- You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box

- example 

1. in HTML
 \<img src="images/magnolia-large.jpg"
 class="large" alt="Magnolia" />

2. IN CSS 
img.large {
width: 500px;
height: 500px;}

- The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element


- background-repeat
  - repeat :The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically
    - repeat-x :The image is repeated horizontally only
      - repeat-y:The image is repeated vertically only
       - no-repeat: The image is only shown once.

- background-attachment
  - fixed: The background image stays in the same position on the page.
    - scroll: The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.



- background-position

When an image is not being
repeated, you can use the
background-position
property to specify where in the
browser window the background
image should be placed

- You can create image rollover effects by moving the
background position of an image.
