# Read: 04 - HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions
## From the Duckett HTML book:
  - Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93)
  - Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)


  ### Links
  Links are created using the <a> element
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>

  - Opening Links in a New Window
  **target**

 *If you want a link to open in a new window The value of this attribute should be _blank.*

 *You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.*

 ### Layout
 - Building Blocks
 *CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.*
  
  

   |name|Examples|
   |----|--------|
   |Block-level elements|\<h1> \<p> \<ul> \<li>|
   |Inline elements|\<img> \<b> \<i>|
  

 - Containing Elements
  *If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.*
**Controlling the Position of Elements**
- Normal flow
- Relative Positioning 
- Absolute positioning


## From the Duckett JS book
- Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.86-99 ONLY)
- Article: “6 Reasons for Pair Programming”


**functions, methods, and objects**
*why we use*
-  to organize their code


 - FUNCTIONS & METHODS
    - *FUNCTIONS*: series of statements that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task*
     - *METHODS*: same as afunction, except methods are created inside (and are part of) an object.*


- OBJECTS 
- BUILT-IN

**FUNCTIONS**
|type|shape|
|----|-----|
|declare|\function sayHelloh(){document.write('hello');}|
|calling|sayHallo();|
|drcluring that need info|funtion getArea(width','hight){return width*hight;}|
|calling that need info|getArea(3,5);|


- ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS & FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS 
  - FUNCTION DECLARATION 
    - FUNCTION EXPRESSION
 
- *VARIABLE SCOPE*
  - LOCAL VARIABLES
   - GLOBAL VARIABLES

**6 Reasons for Pair Programming**
- [x] How does pair programming work?

*While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code*


- [x] Why pair program?
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
